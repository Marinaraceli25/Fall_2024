   <!--Main content for about company-->
   <p>At December 25th Photography Studio, We partner with you, your planner, and designer to develop a personalized photography timeline that ensures stunning results for your special day.

   Our goal is to create a fun and relaxed atmosphere, resulting in natural and candid images rather than overly posed shots. We’re committed to making your photography experience enjoyable and capturing beautiful memories you’ll cherish for year to come. </p>


<h2>Booking</h2> 

<p>Ones you contact us via our Contact form, email, or phone, the next step is for us to learn more about your experience. We’ll provide our detailed pricing brochure and simple, comprehensive questionnaire to get you started. After a quick meeting to get acquainted, we’ll send you contract and finalized proposal for review and signature. Once the booking retainer is paid, your date is secure. As your event approaches, we’ll stay in touch to create a custom photography timeline and offer helpful tips to ensure everything goes smoothly.</p> 

<h2>Image Quality- Quantity</h2> 

<p>The final images in your online gallery will include only the best photos from each angle. Any images with blinking, bad expressions, or blur will not be included.</p> 

<h2> Production </h2>

<p>Your photos are just as important to us as they are to you. After the shoot, we immediately save your files and make a backup for safety. We then adjust exposure, fix color, and apply color grading to all the photos. Select closeup shots will also get high quality skin retouching. You can expect your photos within 7-10 business days, or sooner if requested.</p>
